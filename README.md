The 'blog_list' application, that allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have got from the internet. 
For each blog we save the author, title, url, and amount of upvotes from users of the application. 
The app may be easily modified to save some other interesting 'short_info'-s.

The application approximatelly corresponds to what have to be done  
in the course project: 
Full Stack Open 2020; Helsinki University , part 4 : https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents  

The server is running on localhost:3000 (by 'npm start').

The 'jest' library is used for testing.

The work is in progress.
