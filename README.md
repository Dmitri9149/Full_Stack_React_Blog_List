The 'blog_list' application, that allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have got from the internet. 
For each blog we save the author, title, url, and amount of upvotes from users of the application. 
The app may be easily modified to save some other interesting 'short_info'-s.

The application approximatelly corresponds to what have to be done  
in the course :
